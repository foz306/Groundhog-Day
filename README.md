# Groundhog-Day
An analysis of reactions to my Groundhog Day Facebook status

Since 2012, I have posted this status on or before February 2nd: "I'm watching Groundhog Day but I feel like I've seen it before." 
A friend requested a statistical analysis, so I made a couple bar graphs and a linear regression using ggplot.

While a basic linear regression shows an upward trend, the post has fallen from its peak popularity in 2017. 
I find it curious that the first year, when I really was watching it (for the 100th time), was actually the least popular.

Not surprisingly, Ed has been the most frequent commentor while only missing one year. While I did not perform an actual text analysis, 
the most repeated comments were related to the date of the posting or a variation on "I've seen this post before".
